#Command Line Chess
To learn ruby, I wrote a simple command line version of chess which has the following features:
- Moves for all pieces 
- Move verification (pieces cannot move themselves into check)
- Game save and load functionality
- Move marking, which displays available move locations for the player 
- Addiitonal moves set including En Passant and Promotion
